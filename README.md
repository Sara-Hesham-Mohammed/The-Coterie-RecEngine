# The-Coterie-RecEngine

The Coterie RecEngine is a recommendation engine designed to provide personalized content recommendations based on user preferences and behavior. 
It utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to deliver relevant suggestions. 

## Model
The model itself is not my intellectual property, but the implementation and integration into a REST API is my work.
The model and all functionality is attributed to: https://github.com/wenqifan03/GraphRec-WWW19

## Dataset 
I have trained it on the meetup dataset, which is available at: https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/. 
It was preprocessed and prepared in order to fit the graphrec model.
